## Before starting

Run the [Installation notebook](https://github.com/camilocarvajalreyes/intro_to_NLP/blob/main/Installation.ipynb) for installing packages. Send me an email if anything goes wrong!

## Lecture and Tutorial's objectives
1. Knowing what Natural Language Processing (NLP) is and why it’s important
2. Identify the main algorithms in text representation learning
3. Spot common challenges in NLP and ethical concerns
4. Gain intuition on what kind of information gets encoded in word representations and how it gets shown in the embedding space
5. Get familiarised with the use of pre-trained language models, how to interpret them and implement them in a simple NLP pipeline
